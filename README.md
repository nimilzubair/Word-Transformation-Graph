# Word-Transformation-Graph
This project compares MATLAB and Python performance in finding the shortest and longest transformation chains between words in a dictionary. It uses graph traversal algorithms (BFS &amp; custom path exploration) to analyze execution time and efficiency. The results include performance comparison, path visualization, and execution time analysis.
